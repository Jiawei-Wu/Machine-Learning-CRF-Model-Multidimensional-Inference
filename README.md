# Machine-Learning-CRF-Model-Multidimensional-Inference
The project focused on using data-driven model to realize solar energy inference for implementation layer optimization.  

The multidimensional solar inference is an improvement of one dimension prediction by HMM in my previous repository.  

The model I used is Conditional Random Filed (CRF). Here, I learn the parameter with L-BFGS methods and make the prediction with the Viterbi algorithm.  

In order to verify the soundness of the algorithm. I also used NLP dataset with multidimensional labels to test the model.
